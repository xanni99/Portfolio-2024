        <p className='about-me-text'>Iâ€™m a junior full stack web developer with a passion for both back-end functionality and front-end creativity. While I find myself more naturally adept at back-end development, I still enjoy the challenges and artistic aspects of front-end work. I am excited to continue growing my skills in both of these areas, and I particularly thrive in team environments. Outside of coding, I like to stay active with different outdoor adventures and love exploring new places through travel.</p>
