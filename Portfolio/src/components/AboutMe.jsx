While I find myself more naturally adept at back-end development, I still enjoy the challenges and artistic aspects of front-end work. I am excited to continue growing my skills in botth of these areas and thrive in team environments. Outside of coding, I like to stay active with different outdoor adventures and love exploring new places through travel.</p>
